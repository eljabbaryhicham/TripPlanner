# **App Name**: TriPlanner

## Core Features:

- Homepage with Category Filters: Display the three service categories (car rental, hotels/hostels, transport) with filtering capabilities.
- Service Category Pages: Dedicated pages for each service category, listing available options.
- Service Detail Popup: Display service details in a popup when a service is clicked.
- Reservation Options: Offer two reservation options: an information form for contact via Resend API and a direct checkout option.
- Resend API Integration: Connect to Resend to enable sending emails based on form responses.
- Admin Dashboard Authentication: Secure the admin dashboard with login and password authentication, so the dashboard only shows up for valid logins.
- Service Suggestions: Suggest specific hotels/transportation/rentals, or additional destinations based on past behaviour. Uses AI to determine when and how to provide those prompts, working as a 'tool' that enables discovery.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dusty rose (#C6A4A4) to give the feel of old-world travel.
- Background color: Off-white (#F4F3F1), almost the same hue as the primary but desaturated, for a backdrop that does not distract.
- Accent color: Muted coral (#E9967A), analogous to dusty rose, for a contrast color to be used sparingly in key locations like buttons.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', serif, for a high-end feel; body font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif, for readability in paragraphs of text.
- Use consistent, minimalist icons for categories and features.
- Implement a clean and responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience.
